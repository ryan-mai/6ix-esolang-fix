# Variable

#### Two two my word fam bros making yaps with the variables ðŸ™Š


### Syntax
To declare or assign a variable in 6ix Esolang, use:

```
croski <var_name> fax <value>
```

- `croski` starts the variable statement.
- `<var_name>` is the variable name.
- `fax` means assignment (`=`).
- `<value>` can be a number, string, another variable, or an expression.

### Examples

```
croski x fax 5
croski name fax "Toronto"
croski y fax x addy 10
```

You can also assign the result of a function call:

```
croski sum ahlie add 10 20
```

To print a variable use `allow it`:

```
allow it x
allow it name
allow it y
```

---

This will print `5`, `Toronto`, `15` <br />

We can also combine two variables such as two values and find the sum!

```
croski x fax 5
croski name fax "Toronto"
croski y fax 10

# Change name
croski name x addy y
allow it name

```

This will print `15` since `5 addy 10` or 5 + 10 = 15
